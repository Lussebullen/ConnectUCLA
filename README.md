## Description

The application is a website for hosting UCLA events.
It acts as a billboard where users can create and post their events for others to see, all in order to make events in the UCLA community accessible in a more centralized manner.

## Installation

First and foremost, Node.js is required. It can be downlaoded from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

After cloning the repository, packages and their dependencies should be installed.

To do this, in your CLI navigate to the server and
react-connectucla directories (separately) and run:
npm install

> Expect warnings and vulnerabilities for the client (react-connectucla).  
> The server should be installed with no issues. 

**Running the application**

To launch the backend server:
- Open your commandline
- Navigate to ConnectUCLA/server
- run 'node index'

> If you see "listening on port 5000", the server is running.

To launch the client:
- Open your commandline
- Navigate to ConnectUCLA/react-connectucla
- run 'npm start'

> Your browser should open localhost:3000 and you should see the homepage.
